\title{Determine the support of a partial correlation/precision matrix}
\usage{
sparsify(
  P,
  threshold = c("absValue", "connected", "localFDR", "top"),
  absValueCut = 0.25,
  FDRcut = 0.9,
  top = 10,
  output = "heavy",
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{P}{(Possibly regularized) precision \code{matrix}.}

\item{threshold}{A \code{character} signifying type of sparsification by
thresholding. Must be one of: "absValue", "connected", "localFDR", "top".}

\item{absValueCut}{A \code{numeric} giving the cut-off for partial
correlation element selection based on absolute value thresholding.}

\item{FDRcut}{A \code{numeric} giving the cut-off for partial correlation
element selection based on local false discovery rate (FDR) thresholding.}

\item{top}{A \code{numeric} specifying the exact number of partial
correlation elements to retain based on absolute value.}

\item{output}{A \code{character} specifying the type of output required.
Must be one of: "heavy", "light".}

\item{verbose}{A \code{logical} indicating if intermediate output should be
printed on screen.}
}
\value{
If the input \code{P} is a standardized precision (or partial
correlation) matrix the function returns a sparsified precision (or partial
correlation) \code{matrix} whenever \code{output = "heavy"}. If the input
\code{P} is an unstandardized precision matrix the function returns an
object of class \code{list} whenever \code{output = "heavy"}:
\item{sparseParCor}{A \code{matrix} representing the sparsified partial
correlation matrix.} \item{sparsePrecision}{A \code{matrix} representing the
sparsified precision matrix.}

When \code{output = "light"}, only the (matrix) positions of the zero and
non-zero elements are returned in an object of class \code{list}:
\item{zeros}{A \code{matrix} representing the row and column positions of
zero entries.} \item{nonzeros}{A \code{matrix} representing the row and
column positions of non-zero entries.}
}
\description{
Function that determines the support of a partial correlation/precision
matrix by thresholding and sparsifies it accordingly.
}
\details{
The function transforms the possibly regularized input precision matrix to a
partial correlation matrix. Subsequently, the support of this partial
correlation matrix is determined. Support determination is performed either
by simple thresholding on the absolute values of matrix entries
(\code{threshold = "absValue"}) or by usage of local FDR (\code{threshold =
"localFDR"}). A third option is to retain a prespecified number of matrix
entries based on absolute values. For example, one could wish to retain
those entries representing the ten strongest absolute partial correlations
(\code{threshold = "top"}). As a variation on this theme, a fourth option
(\code{threshold = "connected"}) retains the top edges such that the
resulting graph is connected (this may result in dense graphs in practice).
The argument \code{absValueCut} is only used when \code{threshold =
"absValue"}. The argument \code{top} is only used when \code{threshold =
"top"}. The argument \code{FDRcut} is only used when \code{threshold =
"localFDR"}.

The function is to some extent a wrapper around certain
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=fdrtool}{fdrtool} functions when
\code{threshold = "localFDR"}. In that case a mixture model is fitted to the
nonredundant partial correlations by
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=fdrtool}{fdrtool}. The decision to
retain elements is then based on the argument \code{FDRcut}. Elements with a
posterior probability \eqn{\geq} FDRcut (equalling 1 - local FDR) are
retained. See Schaefer and Strimmer (2005) for further details on usage of
local FDR in graphical modeling.

\examples{

## Obtain some (high-dimensional) data
p = 25
n = 10
set.seed(333)
X = matrix(rnorm(n*p), nrow = n, ncol = p)
colnames(X)[1:25] = letters[1:25]

## Obtain regularized precision under optimal penalty
OPT <- optPenalty.LOOCV(X, lambdaMin = .5, lambdaMax = 30, step = 100)

## Determine support regularized (standardized) precision under optimal penalty
sparsify(OPT$optPrec, threshold = "localFDR")
